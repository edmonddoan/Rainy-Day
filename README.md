Rainy Day Budgeting using AWS
==================================================

This code is a simple Node.js web service deployed by AWS CloudFormation to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.


Purpose of appplication?
------------------
This application was used to help me understand the basics of REST API as well as learning how to work with databases and deploying an app on the cloud.
It is a very simple application that takes the name of new or established users and stores the name into a MySQL database. Users can enter an amount they want to reserve out in preparation for a sitatuion for where their income is disrupted. Users are given the option to add on to their name everytime they enter their name. Everytime the user enters their full name and amount they want to log they are outputted with how much they have in their account. The account is linked to the users name so they must correctly input their name in order to output the correct amount in their account.  

What did I learn making this?
------------------
The program itself is not very complex and just performs a basic task of looking at how much is in your account. This small project helped me understand the basics needed to build on other future applications that I am currently working on.
